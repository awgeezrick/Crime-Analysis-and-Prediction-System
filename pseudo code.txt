Linear Regression Algorithm

Start
Read Number of Data (n)

For i=1 to n:
   Read Xi and Yi
   Next i

Initialize:
   sumX = 0
   sumX2 = 0
   sumY = 0
   sumXY = 0

Calculate Required Sum
   For i=1 to n:
     sumX = sumX + Xi
     sumX2 = sumX2 + Xi * Xi
     sumY = sumY + Yi
     sumXY = sumXY + Xi * Yi
   Next i

Calculate Required Constant a and b of y = a + bx:
   b = (n * sumXY - sumX * sumY)/(n*sumX2 - sumX * sumX)
   a = (sumY - b*sumX)/n
Display value of a and b

Linear Regression is an algorithm based on supervised learning. It is an algorithm which
based on the model to predict the target feature/value using independant variables. The most
important using of this algorithm is to find out the relationship between variables and thier 
forecasting. There are differnet regression model which predict the values using the 
relationship between independent and dependent variables.
Linear regression perform the prediction based on the dependent variable y and 
given independent variable x. This regression method finds the linear relationship 
betweeen input(X) and output(Y). Therefore it is called linear regression.

Hypothesis function for Linear Regression
Y=q1+q2X

While training the model we are given with:
X: input training data
Y: labels to data

When training the model it is the best line to fit so that to predict the value of y from 
the given value of X
q1: intercept
q2: coefficient of X
If we have the values of q1 and q2 our model predict the values of y from input value x.
